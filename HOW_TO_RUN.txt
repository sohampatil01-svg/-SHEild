How to Run "Fake Call & Distress Simulator"

Since you do not have Gradle or ADB installed globally in your CLI, you must use Android Studio.

STEP 1: INITIALIZE
1. Open Android Studio.
2. Click "Open" and select this folder: C:\Users\HP\FakeCallDistressApp
3. Wait for "Gradle Sync" to finish (bottom status bar). This will download the build tools.

STEP 2: RUNNING
1. Connect your Android Phone via USB (enable USB Debugging in Developer Options).
   OR
   Create a Virtual Device (Emulator) in Android Studio (Device Manager).
2. Click the green "Run" (Play icon) button in the top toolbar.

STEP 3: CLI (OPTIONAL)
After you open it in Android Studio once, it creates a "gradlew.bat" file. 
You can then run these commands from this directory:

Build and Install:
    .\gradlew.bat installDebug

Start the App:
    adb shell am start -n com.example.fakecalldistress/.ui.MainActivity
